To get a cookie, pass only a name. It'll return `null` if undefined.
```js
cookie( "foo" );
```

To set a cookie, pass a name, a string value, and optionally a number of days until the cookie expires
```js
cookie( "foo", "bar", 5 );
```

To delete a cookie, pass a name, and a `false` value
```js
cookie( "foo", false );
```
